# Concurrency Simulator
This project simulates a minimal round-robin scheduler. The central scheduler iteratively assigns tasks that have remaining work to worker threads with fixed-size time slices. These worker threads independently execute the assigned work, mark it as done and report back to the scheduler. This simulates a concurrent scheduling toop with low complexity, and demonstrates task selection, time slicing, execution and state updates.
